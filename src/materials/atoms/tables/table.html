notes: |
   Newer assistive software will also immediately interpret any table with the attribute `role=grid` as being for data. 

   Always use `th` to define the headers for columns and rows. If a header cell is not a `th`, but a `td`, use the `scope` attribute to explain what kind of heading the cell is: `scope=row` means the cell is a header for the row it's inside. `scope=column` means the cell is a header for the column it's inside.

<table role="grid">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			{{#each tables.minimum.headings}}
				<th scope="col">{{this}}</th>
			{{/each}}
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		{{#each tables.minimum.units}}
		<tr>
			<td scope="row">{{type}}</td>
			<td>${{income}}<small>/month</small></td>
			<td>${{rent}}<small>/month</small></td>
		</tr>
		{{/each}}
	</tbody>
